                <p class="p">First, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Shreyansh Pandey, and I hail from Uttar Pradesh. I completed my schooling at St'Threses School in 2023, then successfully cleared my LPU-NEST exam and took admission at LPU.
                    I really like to learn new computing languages, and I am also very curious about how computers actually work. In 9th grade, I was introduced to JAVA as my syllabus, and since it was a subject of my interest, I excelled in JAVA and tried to grab as much knowledge as I could at the time.
                    I also like producing music and playing games; they are my stress busters. My family consists of four members, including my father (Additional General Manager of IT Department at Triveni Engineering Pvt. Ltd.), mother (housewife), and elder brother.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Why I chose B-Tech</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="p">I had technical aptitude from childhood, as I liked mechanical toys and electrical equipment more than anything else. I have been exposed to this field ever since I was born, as my father has been in it for almost 20 years and my brother is also an engineer. I am also a tech nerd, and I really like to know more about the hardware and software of computers. In my school, I always got above 90% in the Computer Science subject, which is also a motivation for me to keep studying CS as it always increases my total percentage without putting in as much effort as I do in other subjects. Lastly, computer science is a fast-growing sector with a lot of potential, as we have just found the tip of the iceberg in the form of AI such as Chat-GPT. This sector has a long future, and I am really looking forward to contributing something to it.</p>
